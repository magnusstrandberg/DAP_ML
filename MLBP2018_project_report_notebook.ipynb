    "Music genre classification is an interesting and relevant problem, where the possibility to automatically classify and sort music has many user applications. There is lot of well labeled data available and accessible. Before solving the actual classification problem the data needs to be analysed and pre-processed. Here this was done utilizing Matlab. The provided data set was cleaned of errors, and normalized according to feature group. At this point it was noted that the data set was unbalanced, which put constraints on the classification process. The classification process was done using the Sci-Kit Learn library in Python. As our final classifier we choose the linear Support Vector Classifier, as that yielded good results in the experiments. The accuracy of the model was tested by both accuracy of the predicted labels and the Log Loss metric. Although not excellent the chosen model managed to beat the benchmark and with some smart parameter choices achieve reasonably good predictions."

    "The focus of this project was to be able to correctly classify songs into genres based on a set of features gathered from each song. To do this, the songs feature sets have been divided into a training and a test set, and labels provided for the training set.\n",

For an example see the figure below. As can be seen from the figure the individual lines are not clear but if any data points were to be in another order of magnitude the plot would be skewed and it would be very noticeable. This method is of course only feasible with a small enough feature set that is well understood, but in this case it is good enough. Contour plots were also tried but to properly see the set of songs needed to be cut into small 100 count segments and that made it a not so practical approach.\n",

There for it was concluded to set these to 0, as they were the same for all songs. Figures below shows the a contour map before and after the clean up for the first 50 songs.\n",

    "In Matlab the normalized training data was tested and validated using both the cross fold and hold out [method](#refs). In this case however there were very small differences between the hold out and cross fold method. The data was trained using many of the different classifier options and from this a few different methods were chosen, based on their accuracy scores. During this stage we also tested different feature reduction methods but this had an negative effect on the outcome. Probably because the data set was already quite small. Also undersampling was tested to see if the imbalance of the labels could be handled that way but the effects were worse probably due to the same reasons as with feature reduction. These methods were then further tested in Python. The methods that yielded high results were, Deep Trees and different degrees of Support Vector Machines([SVM](#refs)).\n",

    "There was quite a difference between the training data sets scores and the one from kaggle, but this is to be expected as the methods used has some inherited over fitting that is hard to get rid of. The big suprise though was the difference in the log loss function were the kaggel score was better than the pyhton internal for the training set. For this we have not been able to find a good explanation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results could definitely be improved open but might require some different approaches already on the data preparation and normalization stage. The classifier method used might also not be the best for this kind of a problem. The model seems to have a bit of a problem dealing with the imbalance of the classes. It might be that this is the property that adds the biggest difficulty to the classification problem. In such a case it could be a good idea to go with a classifier that is especially good at dealing with imblanced data sets, such at some kind of [boosted tree model](#refs). \n",
    "\n",
    "However the chosen method managed to beat the benchmark by quite a big margin, 10 percentage points. Also as the dataset was quite small, it is probably not a good idea to go to more advance modern methods which usually requires quite large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However one improvment that could have been done would have been to implment some form of parameter optimizer to finds the optimal parameters for the SVC, something like the `.GridSearchCV`([ref](#refs)).\n"

    "One of the ides we tested before choosing the final method was to super sample the data set in an effort to combat the imbalance between the different classes. As we were afraid that this imbalance would lead bad accuracy, as was stated in the article posted on slack. This however did not in the ned lead to any noticeable increase in accuracy so the it was decided that it is better to go with the simplest solution that achieves good enough results. The matlab code used to generate the supersampled data set is anyway added for curiosa. \n",
